## Skills

I possess strong enterprise systems skills. I have recruited and managed strong teams of people to help develop, implement, and support systems that I have designed. The application of these systems are broad and varied and include medical billing, EDI, B2B, CRM, dashboard, performance measurement and improvement, commissions, time and expense, and inventory.

I have also managed large implementations and ongoing support of the Lawson ERP system including GL,Payroll,HR, and Fixed Assets. In addition, I have implemented and installed several data warehouses used to enable business intelligence aspects of mining enterprise data to enable derivative revenue streams. I have experience with Oracle, Informix, MySQL and MS SQL Server.

I have deployed a full service ESB (enterprise service bus) and directed development harnessing technologies like SOA (service oriented architecture), AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks. I am excited about and committed to emerging technologies that allow for a very structured approach to team development of enterprise, carrier grade software that is well documented, scalable, maintainable, and provides the end user with an interface that allows for the delivery of a desktop quality user experience over a common browser that works irrespective of the users operating platform.  The response from our user community has been overwhelmingly positive.

During my tenure at Connextions, I have been an integral part of the management team, and as such, have been with the company through many pivotal phases of itsâ€™ growth.  I joined Connextions in 2006 when they were a small fulfillment and customer support outsourcer.  I was present as the company was acquired by New Mountain Capital in 2006 and grew explosively year over year, expanding from a single Orlando campus to six sites in four states.  In recent past, Connextions was acquired by Optum, a UnitedHealth Group company.  I have learned a great deal through each of these phases and as a result I feel that I am a much more astute technology & business professional.  

Throughout my career I have had a few successes and a couple of loses; I learned the most from the loses.
